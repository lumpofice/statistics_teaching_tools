## <b>cards</b>
 - deck_cards_binomial_rv_cumulative_prob.py 
  - A program that models a random variable, X, following a binomial distribution constructed within the program. Users choose the size of the draw, n cards, from a 52-card, standard deck, and they choose the event they wish to observe. The event can be as small as a single card or as large as 52 cards. Users also choose the number of successes, k, from the event in their draw of n cards, the theoretical probability of which is computed by the program. Finally, a histogram of the constructed distribution is generated, giving users a visual of the cumulative probability from 0 successes up to and including the number of k successes chosen.
