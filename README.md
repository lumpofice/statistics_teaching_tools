## <b>cards</b>
1. deck_cards_binomial_rv_cumulative_prob.py 
	1. A program that models a random variable, X, following a binomial distribution constructed within the program. Users choose the size of the draw, n cards, from a 52-card, standard deck, and they choose the event they wish to observe. The event can be as small as a single card or as large as 52 cards. Users also choose the number of successes, k, from the event in their draw of n cards, the theoretical probability of which is computed by the program. Finally, a histogram of the constructed distribution is generated, giving users a visual of the cumulative probability from 0 successes up to and including the number of k successes chosen.

## <b>games</b>
1. greedy_pig.py
	1. A game in which users gamble whether or not to roll the die again, collecting points so long as the face value of the die is different from 1. Soon as the face value is 1, all points earned in the round are lost.

## <b>dice</b>
1. greedy_pig_distribution.py
	1. A program that models the geometric random variable, X, followed by the toss of a die in a game of Greedy Pig.
