\section{Data Types}

Data can fall into $4$ different types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nominal
    \item Ordinal
    \item Interval
    \item Ratio
\end{itemize}
across two different categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qualitative
    \item Quantitative
\end{itemize}
Qualitative data indicate the presence of a characteristic. The specimen in question either does or does not have the characteristic. 
\begin{example}
The specimen in question, say a person, either does or does not have brown eyes.
\end{example}

\begin{dataset}
The player's name, `Player', is Nominal data. The set of numbers out to the left of the `Player' column represents an index. An index is used to indicate an order for a given element, which makes indices Ordinal data. \\[1ex]

\begin{dataset}
The player's name, `Player', is Nominal data. The year at which the player began their career, `From', is Interval data. The weight of the player, `Wt', is Ratio data.\\[1ex]

\end{dataset}

\begin{dataset}
The points ranking of the player, `Rk', is ordinal data. The player's name, `Player', is Nominal data type. The total points a player scored during the 2021-2022 season, `PTS', is Ratio data.\\[1ex]
